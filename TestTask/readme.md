# This is my test task. I've made three app, each one's number in dirName is match to the number in assignment.
# To run them with no headache I've created some scripts in package.json, so just run command 'npm run task[n]' n == is number of a task, withought hooks.
# I hope You'll enjoy it, like I, when the code was written. Thank you for Your time.
# With best wishes, Kostya.
