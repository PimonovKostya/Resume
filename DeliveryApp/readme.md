To run this app you firstly need to open it in your IDE and run command 'npm i' to install nodejs packages.
After that, run 'npm run start' and go to /localhost:8000/ on your browser.
This app is too far to be completed and there are many bugs in it, also when u delete order you allways have to refresh page to see difference, but in any case it's ALIVE!!:D
I've tried a lot and its my first application using NEM so I hope u'll enjoy it)
