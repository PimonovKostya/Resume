Hi there!
This is a guide to this app.

IMPORTANT!!!!
This app uses all tables in current schema, but you have to change parameter 'TABLE_SCHEMA'
in GET_TABLES GET_COLUMN_NAMES sql requests and URL 'localhost/...' in utils.Const.

To begin use app firstly choose File/Open, it may not work till connection is not succeed.

Insert command is to create new row in table, but
IMPORTANT!!!!!
if column is a foreign key to another table, you have to add current id from that table,
if such id is not exist, create new row in that table.

Update and Delete function is based on mouse click.
Click on a current data in a row you want to Update and THEN click Update from menu
Delete function will delete full row from table.

If changes does not applied in table try Update/Reload.
